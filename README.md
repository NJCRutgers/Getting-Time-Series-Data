# Getting-Time-Series-Data

## Data Collection Methodology
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development sponsors the research to be done by the U.S. Census Bureau, which selects approximately 500,000 sample points across the country every quarter. They do this through several methods, the most well-known being in-person, though they do also gather information by phonecalls, emails, and online surveys.

## Why I Chose This Data
Housing prices are one of the strongest indicators of the state of the greater economy as everybody needs a house. However, in more recent times, housing has exploded in pricing, and its future is a little uncertain. With the use of time series models, predicting it would provide me with the ability to plan better for when I'd be in the market of purchasing my own home.
